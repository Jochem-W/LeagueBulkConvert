# LeagueBulkConvert
Convert champion models from League of Legends to glTF, with automatic textures and animations.

## How to use
1. Extract the .zip file
2. Run LeagueBulkConvert.exe
3. Select your League of Legends installation directory
4. Select an output directory
5. Optionally edit the config file
6. Click convert

## To-do
* Add a GUI for editing the configuration
* Allow the conversion to be cancelled
* Automatically search for a League installation directory

## Options
`League install directory`: the path to the "League of Legends" folder, e.g. "C:\Riot Games\League of Legends"

`Output directory`: the path to the directory you'd like the .glb files to end up, e.g. "D:\LeagueBulkConvert" (make sure this directory already exists)

`Include skeletons`: include the skeleton for each skin

`Include animations`: include the skin's animations, which requires the skeleton

`Include hidden meshes`: include meshes that would normally be hidden, like meshes used for the recall animation and also includes any meshes that are in "IgnoreMeshes" in the config file

`Save binary files and textures separately`: save the model as a .gltf, with separate .bin and .png files

## config.json
`IncludeOnly`: a list of wad.client filenames that should be extracted, extracts everything by default (the smaller this list the faster the conversion, e.g. `includeOnly: ["Aatrox.wad.client"]`)

`IgnoreMeshes`: here you can specify individual meshes to be ignored for specific skins (an example is given in the default config, enabling "Include hidden meshes" overrides this)

`IgnoreCharacters`: a list of characters that are ignored (you probably don't need to change this)

`ScaleList`: a list of scales I've calculated from the champion's official confirmed heights to resize the model to real life size (you probably don't need to change this)

`ExtractFormats`: files with these extensions will be extracted (you probably don't need to change this)

`SamplerNames`: samplers with these names will be read to see if there is a texture (you probably don't need to change this)

## Troubleshooting
* You need to be connected to the internet to use this program, since it downloads textfiles from GitHub (will be fixed soon)
* You should select an empty directory for the converted files, since the program automatically creates and deletes entire directories recursively
* Some files cannot be parsed because [LoL-Fantome/LeagueToolkit](https://github.com/LoL-Fantome/LeagueToolkit) doesn't support them. Please report these issues there!
* Some skins cannot be saved with a skeleton or with animations, either because of issues in [LoL-Fantome/LeagueToolkit](https://github.com/LoL-Fantome/LeagueToolkit) or [vpenades/SharpGLTF](https://github.com/vpenades/SharpGLTF) (probably the latter.) I'll look into this later.
* The config.json file is case-sensitive!
